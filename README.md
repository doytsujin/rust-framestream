A preliminary implementation of the Frame Streams data transport protocol
for Rust, based on Robert Edmond's [implementation in Go](https://github.com/farsightsec/golang-framestream).

The Frame Streams protocol is used in [dnstap](http://dnstap.info/), a
structured binary log format for DNS software.
